            <p>You were either born into slavery or captured at a very young age. Luckily for you, your fate wasn’t to end up in the obsidian mines, but instead, to live a life of relative luxury. You could be owned by a merchant house, the templarate or a noble house. Recently, you either escaped, were released, or your merchant passed away, granting you freedom.</p>
