            <p>Beginning at 2nd level when you choose this path, you can imbue an area of land and plants with protective magic. By expending a 1st level spell slot, you can ward a circular area centered on yourself with a 20ft radius against Defiling. A Defiler who attempts to draw the energy of this land must make a Constitution saving throw. The defiler suffers 2d6 radiant damage on a failed saving throw, and half damage on a successful save. If you expend a higher spell slot than 1st level, the radius increases by 10ft and the damage increases by 1d6 for each level above 1st.</p>

            <p>Beginning at 6th level, you learn to empower your spells using the life energy of the land, but without causing defiling. When you cast a spell in an area with fertile soil and plant life, you may add your spell casting modifier to the spell's damage roll, if any, and the saving throw DC for that spell is increased by one.</p>

            <p>At 14th level, you can use your action to activate a magical aura that sheds bright light to a radius of10ft, and dim light for another 10ft beyond that. The aura requires your Concentration to maintain, and can be maintained for up to an hour. Within this aura, the following effects apply:
                <ul>
                    <li>Any magical darkness within the aura's radius is dispelled</li>
                    <li>You and your allies within the aura cannot be charmed, frightened or possessed by aberrations or undead, and any of your allies already under such an effect from such a creature has advantage on any new saving throw against the effect.</li>
                    <li>You and your allies within the aura have resistance to bludgeoning, slashing, and piercing damage from nonmagical weapons.</li>
