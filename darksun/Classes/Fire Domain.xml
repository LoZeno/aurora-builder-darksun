            <p>You can use your Channel Divinity to utter ancient words that are painful for Water elementals and Water type creatures. As an action, you present your holy symbol, and each fey or fiend within 30 feet of you that can hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.</p>
            <p class="indent">A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.</p>

            <p>Use your action to activate an aura of holy fire that lasts for 1 minute (regardless of whether you are still alive or dead by then). This aura is centered on you with a 60 foot radius that moves with you. Your enemies within this radius get disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws and your allies get advantage. Those that fail the saving throw take 10D6 fire damage and those that make the saving throw take half damage. They need to make this save every round that they are in the fire including your character. Your character cannot use any magic or item or spell to reduce this damage, and you cannot have another character heal you as the spell continues. The ONLY way that your character can reduce this damage is by a successful saving throw. If your character dies the spell continues until the minute has passed. This spell is in a 60 foot radius sphere.</p>
